# FedEx_Logistics_Performance_Analysis

## What do you suggest the client to achieve Business Objective ?
Based on the analysis of the dataset and the stated business objectives, here are some key suggestions for the client.

Reduce Costs Focus on Cost Outliers: The analysis showed a high variability and significant outliers in Freight Cost for Air and Truck shipments. The client should investigate these high-cost outliers to identify and negotiate better rates, bundle shipments, or optimize routes to reduce costs.
Leverage Vendor Agreements: The data showed a heavy reliance on EXW and FCA vendor terms. This provides FedEx Logistics with control over freight. The client should leverage this control to negotiate directly with carriers and optimize shipping routes to secure the most cost-effective solutions.

Improve Delivery Timelines Reduce Delivery Variance: While the average delivery is early, the wide range of delivery delays (-372 to 192 days) shows a lack of consistency. The client should focus on reducing this variance to ensure more reliable and predictable delivery times for all shipments.
Optimize High-Delay Shipments: The analysis revealed that Ocean shipments have the highest average delivery delay. If these timelines are critical for customers, the client should explore ways to streamline the ocean freight process to minimize delays.

Streamline Operations & Gain a Competitive Edge Specialize in Key Markets and Products: The analysis identified South Africa, Nigeria, and Côte d'Ivoire as key markets and ARV and HRDT as dominant product groups. The client should focus on perfecting logistics in these high-volume areas and capitalize on its expertise in handling specialized medical products.
Benchmark Performance: By continuously analyzing the data, FedEx can set performance benchmarks for different regions and shipment modes. This will allow them to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to maintain a competitive edge.
